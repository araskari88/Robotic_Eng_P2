# Robotic_Eng_P2
This repository contains the files of the second project for the **Robotic Engineering** course from **Udacity**.

The repository contains the **world** file of a building made in the *first project* and a **URDF** model for a **differential robot** (similar to **Roomba**) inside it. A **camera** and a **lidar** sensor are mounted on the robot helping it to **track a white ball inside the world**. The robot will follow a ball inside the world based on the processed image from the camera feedback.
